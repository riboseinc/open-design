= Ribose Open site designs

This repo holds design artifacts for the Ribose Open sites, using an
"open design" process.

This document specifies the intention of the Ribose Open site and some
points of interest for the designer to consider.

== Introduction

The purpose of this site is to showcase and organize
Ribose-developed open source software and open specifications,
and information, news related to them.

NOTE: We found these designs appealing for this purpose:

== Terms and definitions

Ribose open-sourced software::
  located at https://github.com/riboseinc/

Ribose Open Specification::
* Technical specifications that are published for interoperability
  purposes.
* These are new technologies that have not been published at official
  venues.
* By publishing these open specifications ourselves we allow others to
  adopt and improve on them.


Ribose Open Project::
* consists of at least one piece of open-sourced software, and zero or
  more open specifications.
* e.g., the StandardDocument project
  (https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc) contains multiple pieces of
  software, like IsoDoc, CSD, GbDoc, etc; and zero (often one) or more
  open specifications
